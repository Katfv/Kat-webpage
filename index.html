    <h1> Why Exercise/Workout?</h1> 

      <h3> Exercise controls weight</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Exercise can help prevent excess weight gain or help maintain weight loss. When you engage in physical activity, you burn calories. The more intense the activity, the more calories you burn.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        
      <h3>Combats health conditions and disease</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> Regular exercise helps prevent or manage many health problems and concerns including:</li>
        </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Stroke</li>
            <li>Metabolic Syndrome</li>
            <li>High Blood Pressure</li>
            <li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
            <li>Depression</li>
            <li>Anxiety</li>
            <li>Many types of cancer</li>
            <li>Arthritis</li>
          </ul>
      <h3> Improves mood </h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Need an emotional lift? Or need to blow off some steam after a stressful day? A gym session or brisk walk can help. Physical activity stimulates various brain chemicals that may leave you feeling happier, more relaxed and less anxious.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      <h3> Boosts energy</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Exercise delivers oxygen and nutrients to your tissues and helps your cardiovascular system work more efficiently. And when your heart and lung health improve, you have more energy to tackle daily chores.
            <li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      <h3>Promotes better sleep</h3>
      <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
             Struggling to snooze? Regular physical activity can help you fall asleep faster, get better sleep and deepen your sleep. Just don't exercise too close to bedtime, or you may be too energized to go to sleep.
            <li>
          </ul>
        </p>
